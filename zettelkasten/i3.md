## Getting started i3
- i3 is a configurable window manager on linux
- personal: [myconfig](https://github.com/vanhoa27/i3)
- use [polybar](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=polybar&t=newext&atb=v409-1&ia=web) if you don't like the default one  
- if you want to make use of **transparency** features
	- use a composer such as: [picom](https://github.com/yshui/picom)
	- make sure your [terminal emulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator) supports transparency
	- I use [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)
